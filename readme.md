# CloudPRNT Emulator

This is a script I'm using when working with the Star CloudPRNT API. It connects to an CloudPRNT server and can receive images that the server is printing out, thus allowing me to work without a physical printer.


### How to
- run `npm install` from the project folder using terminal/command line.
- from terminal, run `node index.js <poll-url> [options]` to emulate a printer connection.
